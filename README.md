# Covid-19 Representation and Modeling
<img align="right" width="500" src=images/jh-log_cum_cases-USA_most_recent_day.png>This is a portion of an ongoing project.  Currently the only public portion is the data and code necessary to generate an animation of covid-19 spreading across the US.  Data is provided by the Johns Hopkins University and the US Census Bureau.  The animation is automatically regenerated and pushed to this repo everyday at about 6am.

This is a side project of a larger modeling project.

This repo is about putting out interesting bits as I finish them.  Since it is based on selective hardlinks to a private repo and updates are done automatically, it may not always be complete or well documented code, but the images should be.
