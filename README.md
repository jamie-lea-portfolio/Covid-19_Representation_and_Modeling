# Covid-19 Representation and Modeling
This is a portion of an larger project that is on hold.  Currently the only public portion is the data and code necessary to generate these animations.  Data is sourced from Johns Hopkins University and the US Census Bureau (county state shape files and FIPS codes).  The animations and most recent day images are automatically regenerated everyday at 5:00 am CST.

This may be updated with 'new cases' & 'new deaths'.  Howewver, John's Hopkins data is not monotonicly increasing and fixing their data so as to properly calculate the rolling window is not a priority.

Scroll down to see just MO/IL.  Images are 1280x720.  Folder link at bottom.
