# Covid-19 Representation and Modeling
<img align="right" width="500" src=images/most_recent_day.png>This is a portion of an ongoing project.  Currently the only public portion is the data and code necessary to generate an animation of covid-19 spreading across the US.  Data is provided by the New York Times and the US Census Beaureu.  The animation is automatically regenerated and pushed to this repo everyday at about 6am.

Also in progress is representation of the spread as a timeseries of NetworkX graphs with the end goal being diffusion modeling.  That portion is not in this public repo.... yet.

This repo is about putting out interesting bits as I finish them.  Since it is based on selective hardlinks to a private repo and updates are done automatically, it may not always be complete or well documented code.
