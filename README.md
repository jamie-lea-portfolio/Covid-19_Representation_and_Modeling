# Covid-19 Representation and Modeling
<img align="right" width="500" src=images/jh-log_cum_cases-USA_most_recent_day.png>This is a portion of an ongoing project.  Currently the only public portion is the data and code necessary to generate these animations.  Data is sourced from Johns Hopkins University and the US Census Bureau (county state shape files).  The animations and most recent day images are automatically regenerated and pushed to this repo by a cronjob everyday at about 5am Central Time.

Scroll down to see just MO/IL.  Images are 1280x7200.  Folder link at bottom.
